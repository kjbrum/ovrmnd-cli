# Ovrmnd CLI - Planning Summary

## Overview

The Ovrmnd CLI project has been broken down into 5 logical phases that build incrementally toward the complete solution. Each phase delivers working functionality while laying groundwork for subsequent phases.

## Phase Structure

### Phase 1: Project Scaffolding & Core Infrastructure (1-2 days)
- **Purpose**: Establish foundation and tooling
- **Key Deliverables**: TypeScript setup, CLI framework, core utilities
- **Critical Path**: Yes - all other phases depend on this

### Phase 2: Core API Execution (3-4 days)
- **Purpose**: Implement MVP functionality for API calls
- **Key Deliverables**: YAML config engine, authentication, call command
- **Critical Path**: Yes - delivers core value proposition

### Phase 3: CLI Usability & DX (2 days)
- **Purpose**: Improve developer experience
- **Key Deliverables**: List command, validate command, debug mode
- **Critical Path**: No - but highly valuable for adoption

### Phase 4: Performance & Optimization (2-3 days)
- **Purpose**: Add caching and response optimization
- **Key Deliverables**: Response caching, cache management, transformations
- **Critical Path**: No - but important for LLM usage

### Phase 5: Advanced Features (2-3 days)
- **Purpose**: Add convenience features
- **Key Deliverables**: Alias system, test command, init command
- **Critical Path**: No - nice-to-have features

## Total Estimated Duration: 10-14 days

## Key Design Decisions

1. **YAML-based Configuration**: Declarative, shareable, version-controllable
2. **Dual Output Modes**: Human-friendly by default, JSON mode for LLMs
3. **Security First**: Environment variables for secrets, no hardcoded credentials
4. **Extensibility**: Plugin-style architecture with service discovery
5. **LLM-Optimized**: Structured errors, predictable output, alias shortcuts

## Documentation Created

1. **Phase Breakdown** (`docs/phase-breakdown.md`)
   - Detailed phase descriptions
   - Task breakdowns
   - Dependencies and timelines

2. **Progress Tracking** (`docs/phases/PROGRESS.md`)
   - Real-time progress updates
   - Task checklists
   - Blocker tracking

3. **Phase Documentation** (`docs/phases/*/`)
   - README for each phase
   - Detailed task guides for Phase 2
   - Architecture decisions

## Next Steps

1. **Begin Phase 1 Implementation**
   - Set up TypeScript project
   - Install dependencies
   - Create basic CLI structure

2. **Update Progress Tracking**
   - Mark Phase 1 as "In Progress"
   - Update task completion as work proceeds
   - Document any decisions or changes

3. **Continuous Documentation**
   - Update CLAUDE.md with implementation details
   - Keep PROGRESS.md current
   - Document learnings in LEARNINGS.md

## Important Notes

- **Incremental Delivery**: Each phase should produce working code
- **Test-Driven**: Write tests as features are implemented
- **Documentation**: Keep docs updated throughout implementation
- **Flexibility**: Phases can be adjusted based on discoveries during implementation

## Research & Investigation Needed

1. **Cache Implementation**: Evaluate flat-cache vs alternatives
2. **Schema Validation**: Choose between Joi, Zod, or custom
3. **Cross-Platform Testing**: Ensure Windows compatibility
4. **NPM Publishing**: Set up package.json for distribution

The project is now ready for implementation to begin!
