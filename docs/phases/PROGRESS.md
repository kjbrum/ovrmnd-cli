## Current Focus

**Phase**: 4 (In Progress)
**Status**: Cache Command implemented! Phase 4 is 67% complete:
- Response Caching (T-01): ‚úÖ Complete with flat-cache, TTL support, and debug logging
- Cache Command (T-02): ‚úÖ Complete with clear, stats, and list functionality
  - Clear: All cache, by service, or by endpoint with confirmation
  - Stats: Total entries/size, service breakdown, oldest/newest entries
  - List: View cached endpoints with metadata, verbose mode for details
Next: T-03 Response Transformation for field extraction and renaming.

## Blockers & Issues

None currently identified.

## Implementation Notes

### Key Decisions:
- Used js-yaml for YAML parsing
- Implemented Zod for comprehensive schema validation
- Created type-safe configuration system with strict TypeScript
- Separated concerns: parsing, discovery, merging, validation, env resolution
- All logger output (debug, info, warn, error) goes to stderr to keep stdout clean for data
- Switched to JSON as default output format (better for LLM consumption), with --pretty flag for human-readable output

### Technical Debt:
- ESLint disable comment in env-resolver.ts for array type casting

### Performance Considerations:
- None yet

---

## Next Steps

1. Begin Phase 4: Performance & Optimization
2. Implement response caching with TTL support
3. Create cache command for cache management
4. Add response transformation capabilities
