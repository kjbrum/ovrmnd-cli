**Status**: In Progress (25% complete)

**Completed in Phase 5**:
- Alias System (T-01): ‚úÖ Complete - discovered it was already implemented!
  - Alias parsing in YAML configurations
  - Alias resolution to endpoints
  - CLI parameter override of alias defaults
  - Alias validation in config validator
  - Full test coverage

**Next Task**: Init Command (T-03)
- Test command (T-02) has been skipped - functionality was redundant with call command
- Response time tracking was preserved by adding it to debug mode in call command
- Moving forward with Init command implementation

## Blockers & Issues

None currently identified.

---

## Implementation Notes

### Key Decisions:
- Used js-yaml for YAML parsing
- Implemented Zod for comprehensive schema validation
- Created type-safe configuration system with strict TypeScript
- Separated concerns: parsing, discovery, merging, validation, env resolution
- All logger output (debug, info, warn, error) goes to stderr to keep stdout clean for data
- Switched to JSON as default output format (better for LLM consumption), with --pretty flag for human-readable output

### Technical Debt:
- None currently (ESLint issues resolved)

### Performance Considerations:
- None yet

---

## Next Steps

1. Begin Phase 5: Advanced Features & Shortcuts
2. Implement alias system for endpoint shortcuts
3. Create test command for connectivity validation
4. Add init command for template generation

## Change Log

### 2025-07-08
- Phase 5 progressed (25% complete):
  - Alias System (T-01) discovered to be already fully implemented:
    - Complete alias parsing and resolution in call command
    - Full parameter merging with CLI override support
    - Alias validation in config validator with duplicate and reference checks
    - Unit tests already in place in call.test.ts
    - Manual testing confirms full functionality
  - Test Command (T-02) reconsidered and removed:
    - Initially implemented with skipCache option and response time tracking
    - Removed after discussion - functionality was redundant with call command
    - Response time tracking preserved and added to debug mode in call command
    - Decision made to focus on more valuable features instead

### 2025-07-08 (Earlier)
- Maintenance and bug fixes:
  - Moved test YAML files from `.ovrmnd/` to `tests/fixtures/yaml/` to eliminate config discovery noise
    - Created dedicated test fixtures directory for validation test files
    - Prevents invalid test files from generating errors during normal operations
    - Test files can still be validated using `--file` option
  - Improved validate command output formatting
    - Added `dim()` method to OutputFormatter for subtle text
    - Fixed suggestion formatting to use consistent gray/dim styling
    - Removed duplicate icons in validate command output

### 2025-07-07
- Phase 4 completed (100%):
  - Response Transformation Implementation (T-03):
    - Added transform configuration to EndpointConfig type
    - Created ResponseTransformer class for field extraction and renaming
    - Implemented nested field path utilities with dot notation
    - Added array access support with "[index]" syntax
    - Created TransformPipeline for chaining transformations
    - Integrated transformations into API client execution flow
    - Cached responses include transformed data
    - Updated YAML validator to handle transform config
    - Created comprehensive unit tests for ResponseTransformer
    - Created integration tests for transformed API calls
    - Updated testing.yaml with transform examples
    - YAML configuration supports:
      - `transform.fields`: Array of fields to extract
      - `transform.rename`: Object mapping old names to new names
      - Multiple transforms as array for pipeline
    - Examples:
      - Extract specific fields: `fields: ["id", "name", "email"]`
      - Rename fields: `rename: { login: username }`
      - Nested paths: `fields: ["user.profile.name"]`
      - Array access: `fields: ["items[0].id"]`
  - Fixed array field extraction for root-level arrays in transformer (e.g., `[*].id`, `[*].name`)
  - Fixed parameter error message to show correct syntax (`id=<value>` instead of `--id <value>`)
