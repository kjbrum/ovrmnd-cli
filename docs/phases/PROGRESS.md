    - Error handling for API failures and invalid configs
    - Enhanced security validation (HTTPS URLs, env var tokens, no hardcoded secrets)
  - Uses Claude 3.5 Haiku model by default (faster and more cost-effective)
  - Environment variable configuration:
    - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` required for API access
    - `AI_MODEL` to override default model
    - `AI_MAX_TOKENS` to set max response tokens
    - `AI_TEMPERATURE` to control creativity (default: 0)

Phase 5 is now complete! All planned features have been successfully implemented:
- ‚úÖ Alias System (T-01)
- ‚úÖ Init Command (T-03)
- ‚úÖ Batch Operations (T-04)
- ‚úÖ AI-Powered Configuration Generation (T-05)

## Blockers & Issues

None currently identified.

---

## Implementation Notes

### Key Decisions:
- Used js-yaml for YAML parsing
- Implemented Zod for comprehensive schema validation
- Created type-safe configuration system with strict TypeScript
- Separated concerns: parsing, discovery, merging, validation, env resolution
- All logger output (debug, info, warn, error) goes to stderr to keep stdout clean for data
- Switched to JSON as default output format (better for LLM consumption), with --pretty flag for human-readable output

### Technical Debt:
- None currently (ESLint issues resolved)

### Performance Considerations:
- None yet

---

## Next Steps

1. Begin Phase 6: Parallel Batch Execution
   - Implement concurrent request execution
   - Add rate limiting and concurrency controls
   - Enhance progress tracking for parallel operations
2. Consider additional features or improvements
3. Prepare for production release
