## Current Focus

**Phase**: 5 - Advanced Features & Shortcuts
**Status**: In Progress (90% complete)

**Completed in Phase 5**:
- Alias System (T-01): ‚úÖ Complete - discovered it was already implemented!
  - Alias parsing in YAML configurations
  - Alias resolution to endpoints
  - CLI parameter override of alias defaults
  - Alias validation in config validator
  - Full test coverage
  
- Init Command (T-03): ‚úÖ Complete
  - Interactive prompts for service configuration (name, URL, auth)
  - REST API template with CRUD endpoints
  - Bearer token and API key authentication patterns
  - Example aliases and transforms
  - JSON and pretty output modes
  - Overwrite protection with --force flag
  - Global/local directory support
  - Custom output path support
  - Comprehensive unit and integration tests

**Completed in Phase 5** (continued):
- Batch Operations (T-04): ‚úÖ Complete
  - Added --batch-json flag to call command for multiple API calls
  - JSON array input for parameter sets: `--batch-json='[{"id":"1"},{"id":"2"}]'`
  - Sequential execution of batch requests (parallel not implemented for simplicity)
  - Result aggregation with success/failure tracking
  - Two error handling modes:
    - Default: Continue on error, collect all results
    - --fail-fast: Stop on first error
  - JSON output mode: Array of results with success status
  - Pretty output mode: Formatted results with summary
  - Progress indication in debug mode
  - Parameter merging: alias < batch < CLI parameters
  - Comprehensive unit and integration tests
  - Updated testing.yaml with batch operation examples

**Next Tasks**: 
1. AI-Powered Configuration Generation (T-05)

- Test command (T-02) was skipped - functionality was redundant with call command

---

## Blockers & Issues

None currently identified.

---

## Implementation Notes

### Key Decisions:
- Used js-yaml for YAML parsing
- Implemented Zod for comprehensive schema validation
- Created type-safe configuration system with strict TypeScript
- Separated concerns: parsing, discovery, merging, validation, env resolution
- All logger output (debug, info, warn, error) goes to stderr to keep stdout clean for data
- Switched to JSON as default output format (better for LLM consumption), with --pretty flag for human-readable output

### Technical Debt:
- None currently (ESLint issues resolved)

### Performance Considerations:
- None yet

---

## Next Steps

1. Complete Phase 5: AI-Powered Configuration Generation (T-05)
   - Integrate Claude Code SDK
   - Implement natural language prompt processing
   - Add API documentation research capability
   - Create intelligent endpoint discovery
2. Consider additional features or improvements
3. Prepare for production release

## Metrics

- **Total Tasks**: 57
- **Completed Tasks**: 55
- **In Progress Tasks**: 1 (AI-Powered Configuration)

## Change Log

### 2025-07-09 (Later)
- Phase 5 progressed (90% complete):
  - Batch Operations (T-04) completed:
    - Implemented --batch-json flag for call command
    - Added batch JSON parsing and validation 
    - Created batch execution logic with parameter merging (alias < batch < CLI)
    - Implemented error handling modes (continue vs fail-fast)
    - Created dual output formatting:
      - JSON mode: Array of results with success/error status
      - Pretty mode: Individual results with summary statistics
    - Added progress indication in debug mode
    - Created comprehensive unit tests in call.test.ts
    - Created integration tests in batch-operations.test.ts
    - Updated testing.yaml with batch operation examples
    - All linting and type checking passes
    - Decision: Implemented sequential execution rather than parallel for simplicity and to avoid rate limiting issues

### 2025-07-09
- Phase 5 organization update:
  - Moved AI-powered configuration generation from T-03 to new T-05
  - This allows batch operations (T-04) to be implemented first
  - AI enhancement remains a planned feature but is now properly sequenced
- Phase 5 progressed (75% complete):
  - Init Command (T-03) completed:
    - Created InitCommand extending BaseCommand pattern
    - Implemented interactive prompts using prompts package for service configuration
    - REST template includes 5 CRUD endpoints (list, get, create, update, delete)
    - Support for bearer token and API key authentication
    - Example alias and transform configurations included in template
    - Dual-mode output: JSON by default, --pretty for human-readable
    - Interactive mode with --interactive|-i flag for guided configuration
    - File overwrite protection with --force flag
    - Support for --global flag to create in ~/.ovrmnd directory

    - Will allow natural language prompts to generate configs: `--prompt "Find Shopify API docs..."`
    - Plans to integrate Claude Code SDK for API research and endpoint discovery
    - Updated Phase 5 documentation to reference this planned enhancement
    - No separate --ai flag needed - presence of --prompt will trigger AI mode

### 2025-07-08
- Phase 5 progressed (25% complete):
  - Alias System (T-01) discovered to be already fully implemented:
    - Complete alias parsing and resolution in call command
