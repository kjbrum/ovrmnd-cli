# Phase 4: Performance & Optimization

## Overview

This phase implements performance optimizations through response caching and data transformation capabilities to reduce API calls and payload sizes.

## Objectives

1. Implement intelligent response caching for GET requests
2. Create cache management commands
3. Build response transformation pipeline
4. Optimize for LLM token usage

## Key Features

### Response Caching
- TTL-based cache expiration per endpoint
- Cache key generation from request parameters
- Persistent file-based cache storage
- Cache hit/miss statistics

### Cache Management
- `ovrmnd cache clear` - Clear all caches
- `ovrmnd cache clear <service>` - Clear service cache
- `ovrmnd cache clear <service.endpoint>` - Clear specific endpoint cache

### Response Transformation
- Field extraction to reduce payload size
- Field renaming for consistency
- Nested object navigation
- Array transformations

## Technical Approach

### Cache Storage
- Use `flat-cache` or similar file-based solution
- Store in `~/.ovrmnd/cache/` directory
- Implement cache size limits
- Handle cache corruption gracefully

### Cache Key Generation
```
key = hash(method + url + headers + body)
```

## Success Criteria

- [ ] GET requests are cached according to TTL
- [ ] Cache improves performance for repeated calls
- [ ] Response transformation reduces payload sizes
- [ ] Cache can be managed via CLI commands
